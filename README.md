# PortfolioVisualinator
Little visualization tool I am experimenting with. 

2 branches: Master is the one you got to look at. 
Used book 'Deep into Pharo' and the online 'Moose Book' to experiment with browser on zip containing several C#-projects from students. 

Example: doIt: 
PortfolioBrowser openOn:  '/Users/coen/DownloadSubmissions/cohort202008/S1.PD42/submissions/goldbergadele_17342_2234078_-2'
(use a dir existinng on your system).
